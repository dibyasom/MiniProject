            <div class="descr"><p>The series is set in Big City, a colorful world populated by anthropomorphic animals, mythological creatures and humanoid beings. Each episode follows the daily experiences of a blue octopus named Oswald (voiced by Fred Savage), accompanied by his beloved pet hot dog Weenie, and their life in the cheerful and whimsically-designed community of Big City. Commonly, the program concentrates on Oswald's experiences with friends, acquaintances and neighbors, including Henry, a penguin, and Daisy, a flower, among others – and his patient methods of coping with or tolerating different situations and dilemmas, along with his thoroughly optimistic outlook on life.</p></div>

                    <p>I have spent all my childhood watching this show. Its just sweet, fun‑ loving, colourful cartoon. None like this is there so far. I came here straight away when I randomly remembered this show. It deserves a 5 star rating and nothing less. With unbelievably cute characters and very pleasant music, it'll keep you occupied for hours and hours.</p>
